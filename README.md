# SenseTalk_Introduction

I decided to start this Introduction series based on what I learned from what I read. It provided me with a good opportunity to practice and review, and I thought we could create a more explanatory document for those who come after us, so I started this work. I began working on this documentation over the weekend. 

Right now, I’ve tried to provide some very basic syntax information, based on what I’ve learned about SenseTalk so far. I hope this will serve as a good introductory document for people who have no prior knowledge of SenseTalk. I will continue to add more content here. 

Additionally, I created an ultra-basic, simple version in HTML format. If you want, you can also access the site version through the GitHub link below. We can develop this further together later on.

That’s all for now.
