# SenseTalk_Introduction

I decided to start this Introduction series based on what I learned from what I read. It provided me with a good opportunity to practice and review, and I thought we could create a more explanatory document for those who come after us, so I started this work. I began working on this documentation over the weekend. 

Right now, I’ve tried to provide some very basic syntax information, based on what I’ve learned about SenseTalk so far. I hope this will serve as a good introductory document for people who have no prior knowledge of SenseTalk. I will continue to add more content here. 

Please feel free to contribute and add your knowledge as well. 

That’s all for now.
