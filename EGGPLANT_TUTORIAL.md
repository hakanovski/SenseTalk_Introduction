## 1. Understanding Eggplant Functional: The Basics

Eggplant Functional is a GUI test automation tool that uses image-based testing to interact with the system under test (SUT). Unlike traditional testing tools that rely on code or APIs, Eggplant works by recognizing elements on the screen using images, text (via OCR), and coordinates. Here are the core components:

- **SUT (System Under Test):** The application or system you are testing. Eggplant interacts with the SUT through a remote connection.
- **Scripts:** Test scripts written in the SenseTalk language to automate interactions with the SUT.
- **Images:** Key elements on the SUT's interface that Eggplant recognizes and interacts with during testing.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Used to recognize and validate text within the SUT.

## 2. Setting Up Your First Test Script

### 2.1 Connecting to the SUT

Before you can automate any tests, you need to connect to the SUT:

```sensetalk
Connect "192.168.1.100" -- IP address of the SUT

### 2.2 Creating a Basic Script

Let’s start with a simple script that opens an application and performs a basic operation, like logging in:

```sensetalk
Click "LoginButton.png" -- Click the login button
WaitFor "UsernameField.png" -- Wait for the username field to appear
TypeText "testuser" -- Type the username
TypeText Tab -- Move to the password field
TypeText "password123" -- Type the password
Click "SubmitButton.png" -- Click the submit button
```

**Key Points:**

- **Click:** Used to click on an image (button, field, etc.).
- **WaitFor:** Waits until the specified image appears on the screen.
- **TypeText:** Simulates typing text into a field.

## 3. Image-Based Testing

Image recognition is the cornerstone of Eggplant testing. Each element on the SUT’s interface that you want to interact with must be captured as an image.

### 3.1 Capturing Images

To capture images:

- Open the Capture Mode.
- Hover over the element on the SUT.
- Press the Capture button.

### 3.2 Using Images in Scripts

After capturing images, use them in your scripts:

```sensetalk
Click "SearchIcon.png"
WaitFor "SearchField.png"
TypeText "Test Automation"
Click "SearchButton.png"
```

**Tips:**

- Keep your image captures clean and consistent.
- If possible, capture images with distinct shapes or colors to improve recognition accuracy.

## 4. OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

OCR allows you to recognize and interact with text in your application, which is particularly useful when the text might change slightly or when dealing with dynamic content.

### 4.1 Basic OCR Usage

Here’s how to click on a button by recognizing its label text:

```sensetalk
Click (Text:"Login", OcrConfidence:85) -- Clicks on a button labeled "Login"
```

### 4.2 Tuning OCR Settings

Sometimes, you might need to fine-tune the OCR settings to improve accuracy:

```sensetalk
Set the OcrSearchRectangle to (100,100,600,400) -- Defines the area to search for text
Set the OcrLanguage to "English" -- Sets the OCR language
Click (Text:"Submit", OcrConfidence:90)
```

**Key Points:**

- **OcrSearchRectangle:** Limits the area where OCR looks for text.
- **OcrConfidence:** Sets the confidence level required for text recognition.

## 5. Handling Dynamic Content and Resilience

### 5.1 Using Variables for Dynamic Data

When working with data that changes, such as user input or dynamic text, you can use variables:

```sensetalk
put "newuser" into username
put "mypassword" into password

TypeText username
TypeText Tab
TypeText password
```

### 5.2 Implementing Conditional Logic

Sometimes, the script’s flow needs to change based on what’s on the screen:

```sensetalk
if ImageFound("ErrorMessage.png") then
    logError "An error occurred during login."
else
    Click "DashboardIcon.png"
end if
```

**Key Points:**

- **ImageFound:** Checks if an image exists on the screen.
- **Conditional Logic:** Directs the script based on conditions.

## 6. Best Practices for Maintainability

### 6.1 Modularizing Your Scripts

Break your scripts into smaller, reusable functions:

```sensetalk
to Login(username, password)
    Click "LoginButton.png"
    TypeText username
    TypeText Tab
    TypeText password
    Click "SubmitButton.png"
end Login
```

Call the function:

```sensetalk
Login("testuser", "password123")
```

### 6.2 Centralizing Data

Keep your data separate from your scripts:

```json
{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "password123"
}
```

Load this data in your script and use it as needed:

```sensetalk
put file "UserData.json" into jsonData
put jsonData as json into data

Login(data.username, data.password)
```

**Key Points:**

- **Modular Functions:** Makes your scripts more reusable and easier to maintain.
- **Centralized Data:** Simplifies updates when test data changes.

## 7. Troubleshooting and Debugging

### 7.1 Logging

Always log key actions and results to help with debugging:

```sensetalk
log "Starting login process"
Click "LoginButton.png"
log "Login button clicked"
```

### 7.2 Try-Catch Blocks

Handle errors gracefully to prevent script failures:

```sensetalk
try
    Click "NonExistentButton.png"
catch
    logError "Failed to find the button"
end try
```

**Key Points:**

- **Logging:** Helps trace what happened during a test run.
- **Error Handling:** Prevents entire script failures by catching and managing errors.

## 8. Code Reusability in Eggplant Functional

Code reusability is a critical concept in software development and test automation that focuses on writing code in a way that it can be reused across multiple scripts, test cases, or even different projects. In Eggplant Functional, reusability helps you avoid duplication, reduce maintenance effort, and create a more organized and efficient test suite. Here’s how you can achieve and maximize code reusability in Eggplant Functional:

### 8.1 Creating Reusable Functions

Reusable functions allow you to encapsulate frequently used actions or sequences of actions into a single function. This function can then be called whenever needed, rather than rewriting the same code in multiple places.

Example: Let’s say you have a login process that you need to perform in multiple test cases. Instead of writing the login steps repeatedly in each script, you can create a reusable function:

```sensetalk
to Login(username, password)
    Click "LoginButton.png"
    TypeText username
    TypeText Tab
    TypeText password
    Click "SubmitButton.png"
end Login
```

You can then call this `Login` function in any script where you need to perform a login:

```sensetalk
Login("testuser", "password123")
```

**Benefits:**

- **Reduced Duplication:** You avoid writing the same login steps in every script.
- **Simplified Maintenance:** If the login process changes (e.g., the button image changes), you only need to update the `Login` function, not every test script.

### 8.2 Using Parameters in Functions

Functions can be made even more flexible by using parameters. This allows the same function to be used in different contexts with different data.

Example: A function to search for different items on a website:

```sensetalk
to SearchFor(item)
    Click "SearchIcon.png"
    WaitFor "SearchField.png"
    TypeText item
    Click "SearchButton.png"
end SearchFor
```

You can call this function with different parameters to search for different items:

```sensetalk
SearchFor("Eggplant")
SearchFor("Test Automation")
```

**Benefits:**

- **Flexibility:** One function can handle a variety of inputs, making it more versatile.
- **Scalability:** As your test cases grow, you can easily reuse the same functions with different data.

### 8.3 Modularizing Test Scripts

Breaking down your test scripts into smaller, modular components is another way to enhance reusability. Instead of writing one large script, divide it into smaller, logical sections that can be reused independently.

Example: Consider a test for a shopping cart application:

- **AddItemToCart**
- **RemoveItemFromCart**
- **ProceedToCheckout**
- **ApplyCoupon**

Each of these actions can be encapsulated in its own function:

```sensetalk
to AddItemToCart(item)
    Click item
    Click "AddToCartButton.png"
end AddItemToCart

to RemoveItemFromCart(item)
    Click item
    Click "RemoveButton.png"
end RemoveItemFromCart

to ProceedToCheckout()
    Click "CartIcon.png"
    Click "CheckoutButton.png"
end ProceedToCheckout

to ApplyCoupon(couponCode)
    Click "CouponField.png"
    TypeText couponCode
    Click "ApplyButton.png"
end ApplyCoupon
```

These functions can be combined in different scripts to create various test scenarios:

```sensetalk
AddItemToCart("Laptop.png")
AddItemToCart("Mouse.png")
ApplyCoupon("DISCOUNT10")
ProceedToCheckout()
```

**Benefits:**

- **Reuse Across Scenarios:** Modular functions can be mixed and matched to create different test scenarios without rewriting code.
- **Improved Clarity:** Each function performs a specific task, making your scripts easier to read and understand.

### 8.4 Centralizing Common Data and Configurations

Another way to promote reusability is by centralizing your test data and configurations. Instead of hardcoding values into your scripts, use external data files (such as JSON or CSV) and configuration files.

Example: Store common test data like usernames, passwords, and URLs in a JSON file:

```json
{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "password123",
    "baseURL": "https://example.com"
}
```

Load this data in your script and use it as needed:

```sensetalk
put file "TestData.json" into jsonData
put jsonData as json into data

Login(data.username, data.password)
```

**Benefits:**

- **Consistency:** Centralized data ensures all scripts use the same data, reducing errors due to inconsistent values.
- **Ease of Updates:** When test data changes, you update it in one place, and all scripts automatically use the new values.

### 8.5 Reusing Existing Scripts with Insert and Run Commands

Eggplant Functional allows you to reuse entire scripts in other scripts by using the `Insert` and `Run` commands.

- **Insert:** Incorporates another script’s code directly into the current script.

```sensetalk
Insert "LoginScript"
```

- **Run:** Executes another script as a separate process.

```sensetalk
Run "TestCase1"
```

**Benefits:**

- **Reusability Across Projects:** You can develop a library of reusable scripts that can be inserted or run across different test cases or even different projects.
- **Simplified Management:** If a frequently used script needs an update, you only need to change it once, and all scripts that use it will automatically reflect the update.

### 8.6 Handling Changes Efficiently

Even with reusable code, changes will inevitably occur. Here are some strategies to handle changes efficiently:

- **Version Control:** Keep your scripts under version control (e.g., Git). This allows you to track changes, roll back to previous versions if necessary, and collaborate with team members effectively.
- **Refactoring:** Regularly review and refactor your code to improve its structure and make it easier to maintain. Refactoring might involve breaking down large functions into smaller ones or improving the naming conventions to make the code more understandable.
- **Testing Reusability:** Regularly test your reusable functions across different scenarios to ensure they still work as expected after changes are made.

**Benefits:**

- **Adaptability:** Well-organized, reusable code can be easily adapted to accommodate new requirements.
- **Reduced Maintenance Overhead:** By centralizing common logic and data, maintenance becomes less burdensome and more systematic.

### 9. Data-Driven Testing

Data-driven testing is a technique where test scripts are executed with different sets of input data. This approach helps you validate that the application behaves correctly with various data inputs without having to write separate test scripts for each set of data. It significantly enhances test coverage and reduces the effort required to create new tests.

#### 9.1 Setting Up Data-Driven Tests

In Eggplant Functional, you can use external data sources, such as CSV files, Excel sheets, or JSON files, to drive your tests.

**Example:** Suppose you have a login test that needs to be run with different sets of usernames and passwords. Instead of writing separate scripts, you can use a CSV file to provide the data:

```csv
username,password
testuser1,password1
testuser2,password2
testuser3,password3
```

#### 9.2 Implementing Data-Driven Tests

Here’s how you can implement a data-driven test using the CSV file:

```sensetalk
set userData to file "UserData.csv" as table
repeat with each record of userData
    put record's username into username
    put record's password into password
    
    Login(username, password)
    
    if ImageFound("Dashboard.png") then
        log "Login successful for" && username
    else
        logError "Login failed for" && username
    end if
end repeat
```

**Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Coverage:** You can easily test multiple data sets without writing additional scripts.
- **Scalability:** As new data sets are added, the same test script can handle them without modification.

### 10. Test Execution and Reporting

Automating the execution of your test suite and generating reports are crucial aspects of test automation. Eggplant Functional provides various ways to execute tests and produce reports that help you understand test results and track progress.

#### 10.1 Automating Test Execution

You can schedule or automate the execution of your test suite using continuous integration (CI) tools such as Jenkins. This ensures that your tests are run regularly, such as after every code change or at specific intervals.

**Example:** You can run your test suite from the command line, which can then be integrated into a CI pipeline:

```bash
eggplant --suite "MyTestSuite.suite"
```

This command can be scheduled or triggered by your CI tool.

#### 10.2 Generating Test Reports

Eggplant Functional automatically generates detailed logs and reports for each test run. These reports can be customized and analyzed to track the success rate, identify failures, and monitor the overall health of your application.

**Key Points:**

- **HTML Reports:** Eggplant provides HTML reports that are easy to share and review.
- **Log Files:** Detailed log files contain step-by-step results of the test execution, helping you debug issues.

**Benefits:**

- **Continuous Feedback:** Automated execution provides quick feedback on the health of your application.
- **Accountability:** Reports and logs offer detailed records of test execution, which is useful for auditing and troubleshooting.

### 11. Handling Asynchronous Events

Applications often include asynchronous events such as animations, dynamic content loading, or delays in server responses. Handling these events in test scripts is crucial to avoid false failures and ensure that tests are robust.

#### 11.1 Using WaitFor and Wait Commands

Eggplant Functional offers `WaitFor` and `Wait` commands to handle asynchronous events. These commands allow the script to pause until a specific condition is met, ensuring that the script only proceeds when the SUT is ready.

**Example:** Suppose you are waiting for a loading spinner to disappear before proceeding:

```sensetalk
WaitFor "LoadingSpinner.png" to disappear
Click "SubmitButton.png"
```

Or you might need to wait a fixed amount of time before interacting with an element:

```sensetalk
Wait 5 seconds
Click "SubmitButton.png"
```

**Benefits:**

- **Reliability:** Your tests become more reliable by accounting for unpredictable delays or asynchronous events.
- **Avoiding False Negatives:** Proper waiting mechanisms prevent scripts from failing due to timing issues, thereby reducing false negatives.

### 12. Parallel Testing

Parallel testing involves running multiple tests at the same time across different environments, browsers, or devices. This technique significantly reduces the total time required to execute your test suite and allows for broader test coverage.

#### 12.1 Implementing Parallel Testing

Eggplant Functional allows for parallel testing through its integration with CI tools and test management frameworks. You can configure your tests to run on multiple instances of the SUT simultaneously.

**Example:** Using Jenkins or another CI tool, you can configure jobs to run your tests in parallel across different SUTs:

```bash
eggplant --suite "MyTestSuite.suite" --parallel --sut "SUT1, SUT2, SUT3"
```

**Benefits:**

- **Speed:** Parallel execution significantly reduces the time to run the full test suite.
- **Coverage:** Allows you to test across multiple configurations simultaneously, increasing coverage.

### 13. Continuous Integration and Continuous Testing

Integrating Eggplant Functional with continuous integration (CI) tools is essential for ensuring that automated tests are run continuously, providing immediate feedback on new code changes.

### 13.1 Integrating with CI Tools

Eggplant Functional can be integrated with popular CI tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or TeamCity. This integration enables the automatic execution of test scripts as part of the build process.

**Example:** In Jenkins, you can set up a job to run your Eggplant tests every time there’s a code commit:

```bash
eggplant --suite "MyTestSuite.suite" --output "TestResults"
```

### 13.2 Benefits of Continuous Testing

- **Immediate Feedback:** Developers get quick feedback on their changes, enabling faster identification and resolution of defects.
- **Reduced Risk:** Continuous testing helps catch issues early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of critical bugs in production.

**Key Points:**

- **Scalability:** CI integration scales well with large teams and frequent releases.
- **Automation:** Reduces manual testing efforts and improves overall efficiency.

### 14. Advanced Debugging Techniques

When working with complex test automation, advanced debugging techniques become necessary to identify and resolve issues effectively.

#### 14.1 Using Breakpoints

You can set breakpoints in Eggplant Functional to pause the execution of a script at a specific point. This allows you to inspect variables, review the SUT’s state, and step through the script line by line.

**Example:** Adding a breakpoint in your script:

```sensetalk
breakpoint
Click "SubmitButton.png"
```

#### 14.2 Analyzing Logs

Eggplant generates detailed logs during test execution. Analyzing these logs can help identify where and why a test failed.

**Key Points:**

- **Error Logs:** Review error messages and stack traces to understand failures.
- **Execution Flow:** Follow the execution flow in the logs to see where the script diverged from the expected behavior.

**Benefits:**

- **Precision:** Advanced debugging helps you pinpoint the exact cause of failures.
- **Efficiency:** Quickly resolving issues allows for more productive testing and development cycles.

### 15. Best Practices for Test Automation with Eggplant

Lastly, adhering to best practices in test automation ensures that your test suite remains maintainable, scalable, and effective.

#### 15.1 Keep Tests Independent

Each test should be independent and not rely on the outcome of another test. This ensures that a failure in one test doesn’t cause cascading failures in other tests.

#### 15.2 Regularly Refactor Test Scripts

Regularly review and refactor your test scripts to remove redundancies, improve readability, and optimize performance.

#### 15.3 Maintain a Clear Naming Convention

Use clear and consistent naming conventions for your scripts, functions, images, and variables. This makes it easier to understand and manage your test suite.

**Example:** Prefix function names with the action they perform (e.g., `LoginUser`, `SearchItem`).

**Benefits:**

- **Maintainability:** Clear and well-structured tests are easier to maintain and scale.
- **Collaboration:** Following best practices makes it easier for team members to collaborate on test automation.

### 16. Dynamic Test Reporting in Eggplant Functional

Eggplant Functional provides robust capabilities for dynamic test reporting. This section covers how to generate automated reports based on test executions, including handling dynamic test case names and Suite Statistics.

#### 16.1 Generating Automated CSV Reports

To create a CSV report after running multiple test cases in Eggplant Functional, you can incorporate dynamic test result capturing directly into your test scripts.

**Example Script: Automated CSV Reporting**

```sensetalk
// 1. Initialize CSV File
put "Test Name, Status, Duration, Comments" into csvHeader
put csvHeader & return into file "TestResults.csv"

// 2. Define Test Cases
set testCases to ("Test Case 1", "Test Case 2", "Test Case 3", "Test Case 4")

// 3. Execute Tests and Capture Results
repeat with each testCase in testCases
    set startTime to now
    try
        // Placeholder for actual test steps
        // Example: if the test case involves logging in
        if testCase is "Test Case 1" then
            Click "LoginButton.png"
            TypeText "username"
            TypeText tab
            TypeText "password"
            Click "SubmitButton.png"
            if ImageFound("Dashboard.png") then
                put "Passed" into testStatus
                put "Login successful" into testComments
            else
                put "Failed" into testStatus
                put "Dashboard not found" into testComments
            end if
        end if
    catch
        put "Failed" into testStatus
        put "An error occurred during " & testCase into testComments
    end try
    
    set testDuration to the seconds of (now - startTime) & "s"
    
    // 4. Write Results to CSV
    put testCase & "," & testStatus & "," & testDuration & "," & testComments & return after file "TestResults.csv"
end repeat

// 5. Log the Completion of the Report
log "CSV report created successfully: TestResults.csv"
```

#### 16.2 Handling Dynamic Test Cases and Suite Statistics

When working with dynamically generated Suite Statistics, it's essential to process the data correctly and generate accurate reports. Eggplant Functional allows you to read the Suite Statistics file and format the data into a CSV report.

**Example Script: Processing Suite Statistics**

```sensetalk
// 1. Read Suite Statistics File
put file "Results/SuiteStatistics.txt" into suiteStats

// 2. Initialize CSV Report
put "Script, Last Status, Runs, Fails, First Run, Last Run, Avg Time (Success)" into csvHeader
put csvHeader & return into file "SuiteStatisticsReport.csv"

// 3. Process Each Line in Suite Statistics
repeat with each line of suiteStats
    if line is not empty then
        put word 1 of line into testCaseName
        put word 2 of line into lastStatus
        put word 3 of line into runCount
        put word 4 of line into failCount
        put word 5 of line into firstRun
        put word 6 of line into lastRun
        put word 7 of line into avgTime
        
        // 4. Write the Processed Data to CSV
        put testCaseName & "," & lastStatus & "," & runCount & "," & failCount & "," & firstRun & "," & lastRun & "," & avgTime & return after file "SuiteStatisticsReport.csv"
    end if
end repeat

log "Suite Statistics CSV report created successfully."
```

### 17. Handling Different Test Case Types Dynamically

Different test cases (such as TBA, NADL) might require specific handling in terms of naming conventions, result processing, and reporting. This section explores how to dynamically manage different test types within a single framework.

#### 17.1 Dynamic Test Type Handling

In complex test suites, you may encounter different types of test cases, each with unique identifiers like "TBA" or "NADL." It is crucial to manage these dynamically to generate accurate reports.

**Example: Handling Different Test Case Types**

```sensetalk
// 1. Identify and Process Test Type
repeat with each line of suiteStats
    if line contains "TBA" then
        put "TBA_TestResults.csv" into fileName
    else if line contains "NADL" then
        put "NADL_TestResults.csv" into fileName
    else
        put "General_TestResults.csv" into fileName
    end if
    
    // Process the line and write to the corresponding file
    put line & return after file fileName
end repeat
```

### 18. Dynamic Naming Conventions for Test Reports

Maintaining clear and consistent naming conventions is essential, especially when dealing with dynamically generated reports across various test case types. This section discusses best practices for naming your reports and how to implement these dynamically within your scripts.

#### 18.1 Dynamic Naming Based on Test Types and Execution Time

Dynamic naming conventions help in keeping reports organized and easily identifiable. This is particularly useful when multiple test cases are run in sequence or across different environments.

**Example: Dynamic Naming Convention**

```sensetalk
// Dynamic naming based on test type and timestamp
put "TBA_TestResults_" & the short date & "_" & the time into fileName
replace all spaces in fileName with "_" // Remove spaces to avoid filename issues
put ".csv" after fileName

put "Test Name, Status, Duration, Comments" into csvHeader
put csvHeader & return into file fileName

log "CSV report initialized: " & fileName
```

### 19. Best Practices for Automated Reporting

Automated reporting is a key aspect of test automation. Proper implementation can greatly enhance the effectiveness and usability of your tests. This section outlines best practices for generating, maintaining, and distributing automated reports in Eggplant Functional.

#### 19.1 Consistent Report Formats

Ensure that all reports follow a consistent format, making it easier to compare results across different runs or test cases. This includes standardized headers, naming conventions, and data presentation.

#### 19.2 Automation of Report Distribution

Consider automating the distribution of test reports via email or other communication tools. This can be achieved using external scripts like PowerShell if SMTP access is restricted within Eggplant Functional.

**Example: Automating Report Distribution**

```powershell
# PowerShell script to send an email with the generated CSV report attached
$EmailFrom = "your_email@example.com"
$EmailTo = "recipient@example.com"
$Subject = "Automated Test Results"
$Body = "Please find the attached test results."
$SMTPServer = "smtp.yourserver.com"
$Attachment = "C:\path\to\TestResults.csv"

Send-MailMessage -From $EmailFrom -To $EmailTo -Subject $Subject -Body $Body -SmtpServer $SMTPServer -Attachments $Attachment
```
